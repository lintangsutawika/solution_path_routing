The greenhouse effect is primarily driven by the atmosphere itself.\n\nB.

This is not accurate because the destruction of the ozone layer would not directly affect the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect is related to the presence of gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor, not the ozone layer.\n\nOption B states that without a strong magnetic field, which enhances the greenhouse effect, Mars cooled down. This is incorrect because a magnetic field does not enhance the greenhouse effect; it protects the planet from solar wind, which can strip away atmospheric gases.\n\nOption C claims that without a strong magnetic field, the solar wind stripped away most of the atmosphere, significantly reducing the greenhouse effect and cooling Mars down. This is a plausible explanation because the solar wind can strip away lighter elements from the atmosphere, such as hydrogen and helium, which are key components of the greenhouse effect.\n\nOption D suggests that without a strong magnetic field, the planet receives fewer charged particles from the solar wind and is therefore not heated as much.

In rotational motion, the tangential velocity (v) at any point on the disk is given by \\(v = r\\omega\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from the point to the axis of rotation and \\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity.\n- Since different points have different distances from the axis (\\(r\\)), their velocities will be different unless the angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) is zero (which would mean no rotation).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the period of rotation.\n- The period (T) of rotation is the time taken for one complete revolution and is independent of the radius for uniform circular motion.
